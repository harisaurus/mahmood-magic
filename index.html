    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Mahmood Magic are two brothers who have, through the deserts of Arabia to the ruins of Matchu Piccu in Peru and to the wonders of the Great Wall of China, learned the secrets to the art of mentalism and magic. Rather than using elaborate objects, sets, and machines, they bring a <strong>simpler touch to magic</strong> that has rarely been seen before.</p>

    <p>Using day to day ordinary objects, the brothers have used their skills to entertain many guests at different venues ranging from Bar/Bat Mitzvas, Speaker Series, Weddings, Bridal Showers, Fundraisers, Birthdays Parties, Corporate Events, Family Holidays, and Banquet Dinners.</p>
