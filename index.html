    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Mahmood Magic are two brothers who have, through the deserts of Arabia to the ruins of Matchu Piccu in Peru and to the wonders of the Great Wall of China, learned the secrets to the art of mentalism and magic. Rather than using elaborate objects, sets, and machines, they bring a <strong>simpler touch to magic</strong> that has rarely been seen before.</p>

    <p>Using day to day ordinary objects, the brothers have used their skills to entertain many guests at different venues ranging from Bar/Bat Mitzvas, Speaker Series, Weddings, Bridal Showers, Fundraisers, Birthdays Parties, Corporate Events, Family Holidays, and Banquet Dinners.</p>

    <p>Mahmood Magic perform in a walk-around environment where everyone gets an up-close, personal and intimate experience while also performing parlour routines. The brothers love magic for the way it impacts people and provides entertainment for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Why Magic?</h2>
    <p>Why are the Mahmood Brothers fascinated in the art of magic? What has driven them and motivated their careers? It is an important but simple answer and has to be seen and experienced to be understood.</p>

      “We had Mahmood Magic perform at my son’s Bar Mitzvah at the Hard Rock Café. They <em>captivated</em> the audience and did a particularly great job getting groups to mingle and feel great, as they performed walk around tricks that everyone found both captivating and amazing. They also performed larger scale illusions that wow’ed the audience. They were a pleasure...”
